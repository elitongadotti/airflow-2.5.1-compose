# airflow-2.5.1-compose
Docker compose file and configs to run an Airflow instance

The Dockerfile image used is only an customized version of an [official](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/release_notes.html#airflow-2-5-1-2023-01-20) image that I get from Apache.

All you need to do is instal Docker, Docker compose and configure image and/or docker-compose file to suit your needs. I already configured some properties to fit my needs. You can check it in docker-compose file.

The apache official docs on how to docker compose can be found [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.5.1/howto/docker-compose/index.html).
